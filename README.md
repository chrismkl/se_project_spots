editing the profile of the user, and likin the image. The ability to view the app in desktop view as well as mobile browser.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
